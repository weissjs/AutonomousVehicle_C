# AutonomousVehicle_C

These files are part of a project which I completed in December of 2018.

The requirements were to use an STM32 platform to create an autonomous vehicle. 
We were constrained by not being able to use software drivers for the components. 
The vehicle must be able to follow a black line on the ground as well as solve a maze and draw a predefined picture.
