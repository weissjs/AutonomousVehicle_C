# AutonomousVehicle_C

These files are part of a project which I completed in December of 2018.

The requirements were to use an STM32 platform to create an autonomous vehicle. 
We were constrained by not being able to use pre-built libraries for the sensors and motors. 
The vehicle must be able to follow a black line on the ground as well as solve a maze and draw a predefined picture.
